Stratumkey is a physical access control system originally designed for enabling
members of Stratum0 [1] to enter the hackerspace.

The current implementation uses a large 3-pin male audio jack (6.3mm) on the
slave side (the "key") and female audio jack on the master side (the "door").
Inside the housing of the key is a small MCU (e.g. ATTiny85), that is powered
over two of the three pins.
The third pin is used for communication: We use a very simple one-wire protocol,
which only supports two devices on the bus (master and slave). As our system is
not intended to use more than two devices physically, we omitted the addressing.

This repository holds the software part of the project. For more information,
